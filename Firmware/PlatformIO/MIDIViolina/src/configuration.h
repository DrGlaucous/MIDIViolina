//Configuration
//this program was built using PlatformIO.
//with some tweaks, it COULD be built using the arduino IDE enviroment. All libraries used in this project are arduino


//this is not really needed, but I have it here for my personal reference. the arduino IDE doesn't like it here, but platformIO doesn't mind
#ifndef USING_STM32
// Note: this needs to match with the PIN_MAP array in board.cpp
//STM32 pin mapping

#define CONTINUOUS_ACTIVE_ANGLE 700//the angle it uses when rotating (i believe the more different it is from the rest angle, the faster the servo will go)

#define SMOOTH_SWEEP//sweeps the servo at a controlled rate, giving steps of angles. if not defined, servos will sweep with only the min and max angles (this is faster, but less well-timed)

//#define WAIT_UNTIL_DONE//will not try to play another note on the servo until it has retracted fully
